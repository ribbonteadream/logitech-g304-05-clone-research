# logitech-g304-05-clone-research
Some of my initial findings of a cheap (4 dollar USD) logitech G304 / G305 clone. 

## Ways to tell you have a clone
- Will not connect to Logitech G Hub
- DPI Button changes different colors (In order from slowest to fastest: Blue > Yellow > Red > Green)
- In linux, the device ID is 32c2:0066
